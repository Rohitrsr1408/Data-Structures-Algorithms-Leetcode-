# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Leetcode-

This repository is my personal collection of DSA problems and solutions that I solve regularly. It includes problems from various platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG, etc.) with clear, optimized solutions in C++/Java/Python (depending on the problem).

ðŸ“Œ What youâ€™ll find here:

Well-structured solutions for common DSA problems

Different approaches (brute force â†’ optimized)

Code with explanations and comments

Practice for interview preparation & competitive programming

âš¡ Goal: To strengthen problem-solving skills, master core DSA concepts, and build a resource that can help others in their coding journey.
